## Description

When you have a new notification (for example, when someone likes your shot or follows you), the extension button will display a badge. Clicking on the button will open a quick drop down menu with your most recent notifications. You can also access to dribble detail page notifications directly from the extension. This way, you can get information of your Dribbble activity from anywhere on the Web. Go to see all incoming activity & clean the NEWs badge.
